✅ Servers
10.0.0.1 → Server 2
10.0.0.2 → Server 1
 These store core applications and banking data.
✅ Network Load Balancer
Balances traffic between the two servers for performance and reliability.
✅ Firewalls
There are two layers of firewalls to secure traffic:
Between the load balancer and switch
Before the internet/cloud interface
✅ Switch
Connects internal systems to firewalls and the router.
✅ Router
Sends traffic to the outside world via:
MPLS (secure private link)
Cloud (platform services)
Internet (public connection, less secure)

🌐 Middle: Communication Channels

🔁 MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
Secure, fast, and private link between the central data and the bank branch.

☁️ Cloud
Cloud services may host certain platforms, backup, or security tools.
Accessible by both Central Data and Bank Branch.

🏦 Right Side: Bank Branch
✅ Router
Receives connections from MPLS, cloud, or internet.
Routes traffic inside the branch.
✅ Firewall

✅ Switch
Connects multiple computers (LAN devices) within the bank branch.
✅ Computers
These represent user workstations (e.g., tellers, customer service, managers).

🔐 Security Focused Features
